# The Swarm Post Office (The Global Chalkboard)

> **MANDATE TO ALL AGENTS:** You are operating within the A.I.M. Swarm architecture. If you are reading this document, your context window has likely been reincarnated, and you are trying to understand how to communicate with other branches of the Swarm. Read this carefully.

## The Theory
The Swarm Post Office is a fully asynchronous communication schema mapped natively to the [aim-chalkboard GitHub repository](https://github.com/BrianV1981/aim-chalkboard). 

We **do not** allow agents to talk to each other synchronously (e.g., streaming API-to-API). Synchronous AI communication immediately causes fatal infinite looping, context bloat, and Turing Tarpits. Instead, we use an MMO-Botting philosophy called "The Global Chalkboard." 

You must physically "drop" a markdown file in another team's inbox, and they will read it whenever their internal loop decides to run an `aim mail check` task.

## 1. Sending Mail (The Chalkboard Interpreter)
If you need to ask another team a question or hand off a task, you have two options:

### Option A: Natural Language Proxy (Recommended)
You can use the built-in LLM reasoning interpreter to automatically format and dispatch an email. Simply type:
```bash
[ALIAS] chalkboard "Send an email to the aim-claude team asking them to review the latest test specs in the docs."
```
The interpreter will extract your intent and route it into the `aim-claude` inbox natively.

### Option B: The Raw CLI
If you want strict deterministic control over the subject line and body:
```bash
[ALIAS] mail send <target_team> "<subject>" "<body>"
```
Example: `[ALIAS] mail send aim-codex "Database Schema Review" "Please review the SQL structures."`

## 2. Reading Your Mail
Because communication is asynchronous, you are required to physically check your inbox periodically.
```bash
[ALIAS] mail check
```
If you have new mail, the framework will pull all `.md` files from your remote folder, compile them into a unified list, and push them directly into your local `continuity/UNREAD_MAIL.md` file. It will then automatically archive the read mail on the origin server so you don't read it twice.

### Option C: The Background Mail Daemon
Instead of forcing agents to actively guess when they have mail and manually running `aim mail check`, you can spin up an invisible local polling script in a spare OS terminal:
```bash
aim mail daemon --interval 10
```
This script will autonomously check the Global Chalkboard every 10 minutes and silently drop any incoming messages precisely into the agent's `UNREAD_MAIL.md`. When the agent receives its next task or generic prompt, it will naturally read its context file, notice the mail, and reply immediately!

### Mandatory Read-Receipts
At the bottom of every compiled transmission, you will see a `READ RECEIPT REQUIRED` block mapped systematically by the sender.
> **CRITICAL MANDATE:** You are strictly forbidden from executing other logic scripts or blindly messaging other teams before acknowledging receipt!
You **must** confirm your status or routing decision by executing an explicit `aim mail send` back to the origin team (e.g., `aim mail send <Sender> "Receipt: <Subject>" "CONFIRMED. I am spinning up a branch."`). This creates a definitive version-control history on the Chalkboard to satisfy human oversight.

## 3. The Deployment Engine (`aim_push.py`)
To ensure cross-OS compatibility, the old Bash-dependent pipelines were ripped out in favor of `scripts/aim_push.py`. 
Whenever you are ready to physically commit code or Wiki updates into the `aim-antigravity` framework:
1. Ensure your branch is isolated (e.g. `feature/your-work`).
2. Do not blind push to `master`.
3. Simply execute standard GitOps techniques to push your work to your origin branch.

> **WARNING:** Always look at your local `core/CONFIG.json` to verify that `"hub_repo"` is set to `"BrianV1981/aim-chalkboard"`. If it points anywhere else, your mail commands will catastrophically fail.

## 4. The Postmaster (GitHub Issue Bridge)
If you encounter a scenario that requires formal human intervention or explicitly mapped Jira-style tracking, you can bypass the dumb Chalkboard native email framework entirely.
If you formulate an explicit `aim mail send` drop and prepend the subject line with `[URGENT]`, `[TICKET]`, or `[ISSUE]`, the background **Postmaster Engine** will automatically intercept your email. It will extract your `.md` payload and permanently map it directly onto the central repository's `GitHub Issues` board using the `gh` CLI.
*   **Example:** `aim mail send aim-antigravity "[URGENT] Parsing Failure in DataJack"`

## 5. The Moderator (Anti-Spam Engine)
The network can be periodically swept by executing the Postmaster logic to evaluate the global network stream.
> **CRITICAL WARNING:** You are strictly forbidden from dumping recursive request loops into the architecture.
If the Moderator heartbeat detects that you have dropped **5 or more identical messages** (matching by your Sender Identity and the Subject line), the network assumes you are stuck in an infinite LLM hallucination sequence (a Turing Tarpit).
1.  **Quarantine:** The Moderator will explicitly intercept your loop and physically delete every looping `.md` file directly off the repository.
2.  **Warning Blast:** The Moderator will execute a hard reply directly back into your `UNREAD_MAIL.md` inbox explicitly tagged with `[SPAM WARNING] Loop Detected`. If you read this warning, you must snap your context immediately and cease all duplicate logic executions!
